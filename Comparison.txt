Python Comparison Operators: 
Following table shows all the comparison operators supported by Python language. Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20 then: 
 	   
== 	Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true. 	(a == b) is not true. 
	   
!= 	Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true. 	(a != b) is true. 
	   
<> 	Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true. 	(a <> b) is true. This is similar to != operator. 
	   
> 	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. 	(a > b) is not true. 	   

< 	Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. 	(a < b) is true. 	
   
>= 	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. 	(a >= b) is not true. 	   

<= 	Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. 	(a <= b)
