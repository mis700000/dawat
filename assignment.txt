Python Assignment Operators: 
Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20 then: 
	   
= 	Simple assignment operator, Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand 	c = a + b will assigne value of a + b into c 
	   
+= 	Add AND assignment operator, It adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left operand 	c += a is equivalent to c = c + a 
	   
-= 	Subtract AND assignment operator, It subtracts right operand from the left operand and assign the result to left operand 	c -= a is equivalent to c = c - a 
	   
*= 	Multiply AND assignment operator, It multiplies right operand with the left operand and assign the result to left operand 	c *= a is equivalent to c = c * a 
	   
/= 	Divide AND assignment operator, It divides left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left operand 	c /= a is equivalent to c = c / a 	
   
%= 	Modulus AND assignment operator, It takes modulus using two operands and assign the result to left operand 	c %= a is equivalent to c = c % a 
	   
**= 	Exponent AND assignment operator, Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators and assign value to the left operand 	c **= a is equivalent to c = c ** a
